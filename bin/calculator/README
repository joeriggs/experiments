The class heirarchy looks like this:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
|                             main()                            |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 -----------  --------------------------------------------------
| raw_stdin ||                    calculator                    |
 -----------  --------------------------------------------------
              -----------  -----------  -----------  -----------
             |   list    ||  operand  || operator  ||   stack   |
              -----------  -----------  -----------  -----------

main() provides the character-based interface to the user.

raw_stdin provides an interface between main() and the console device, allowing
the user to have a better interactive interface.

calculator is the engine.  It parses the user input and drives the calculator
operation.

list is a doubly-linked list.  It is used to store the user-input infix
equation and the internally-generated postfix equation.

operand is used to store each operand.

operator is used to store each operator.

stack is used to convert infix to postfix, and to process postfix.
