This repo doesn't contain a product or framework.  It contains a bunch of
test programs and shell scripts that I accumulate during the course of my
regular work day.  It's organized as follows:

bin contains C programs.  I'm a software engineer.  I spend most of my day
working in C.  So this is the language where it's most likely for me to need to
write experimental programs.

scripts contains BASH shell scripts.  A lot of these are actually used as part
of my normal work day.  Others are experiments.
