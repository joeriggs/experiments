My Miscellaneous Experiments
============================

This repo doesn't contain a product or framework.  It just contains a bunch of test programs and shell scripts that I have accumulated during the course of my regular work day.  The repo is organized as follows:

* **c_progs** contains C programs.  I'm a software engineer.  I spend most of my day working in C.  So this is the language where it's most likely for me to need to write experimental programs.

* **scripts** contains BASH shell scripts.  A lot of these are actually used as part of my normal work day.  Others are experiments.
